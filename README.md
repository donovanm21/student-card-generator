# A simple php student card generator

<img src="" >

The application allows anyone to adjust the content with minimal coding experience to reflect details for your particular use case.

Simply replace the logo.jpg file with a version of your own logo to have it reflect on the student card template.

All other fields can be altered by using the input fields and updating the card.

Download each card once generated to a jpg file.
