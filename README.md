# Simple Student Card Generator

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donovanm21/student-card-generator/main/app.png" >

- The application allows anyone to adjust the content with minimal coding experience to reflect details for your particular use case (Events cards, access card etc).
- Simply replace the logo.jpg file with a version of your own logo to have it reflect on the student card template.
- All other fields can be altered by using the input fields and updating the card.
- Download each card once generated to a jpg file.

## Run the app on my machine

Simply download MAMP (For Mac) or XAMP (For Windows) and copy the content into the htdocs folder to use the application locally.

MAMP - https://www.mamp.info/en/mac/ <br>

A quick search on Youtube for "How to install / use mamp" will give you step by step instruction on getting it setup.
